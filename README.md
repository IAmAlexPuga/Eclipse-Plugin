Implemented operators, operands, unique operators, unique operands, number of comments, number of lines of comments, number of looping statements, number of expressions, Halsted length, Halsted vocab, Halsted volume, Halsted difficulty, Halsted effort. Operators are assumed to be any +,/,*,-,%,+=, -=, etc... when defining or assigning a variable. The trailing * from imports are not considered to be an operator. Operands are any number or variable used to determine a variable. When determining unique operands, there is an assumption that class definitions and imports are not considered to be operands. Any nested function calls within an expression should be considered as one operand. i.e. int i = foo.getData().size() should be considered one operand. Any variables passed into a function call should also be counted as operands.
